Test parameters: 1000 trials, threads each counting to 1000
I ran the tests on my personal laptop (only 4 cores) because I don't appear to
have access to the ecen5033 machine currently.

1. Test results:
TreeLock, 8 threads, average over 3 trials: 2506 ms
TreeLock, 64 threads average over 3 trials: 39893 ms

2. Test results:
Bakery, 8 threads, average over 3 trials: 2915 ms
Bakery, 64 threads: I watch a 45 min episode of Star Trek and it didn't finish the first trial
